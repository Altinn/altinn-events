# Classify Trivy findings for the application image into actionable mitigations
# and render a markdown table to the GitHub Actions job summary.
#
# For every CRITICAL/HIGH finding it decides one of:
#   - App dependency          -> fix in the .csproj (not a base-image concern)
#   - Base image bump         -> a newer base image already ships the fix
#   - Not yet fixed upstream   -> present in the latest base too; needs a
#                                 Dockerfile workaround or an upstream fix
#
# "Base-origin" (i.e. comes from the base image, not your app) is determined
# from the app scan alone: OS packages (Class == os-pkgs) and .NET assemblies
# under the shared framework path (usr/share/dotnet/...). The app's own NuGet
# packages -- whose deps.json Target is under app/ -- are app dependencies.
# (Trivy labels both the runtime and the app's deps.json as Type dotnet-core,
# so the location, not the type, is what discriminates them.)
# Whether a base-origin finding is already fixed is answered by diffing its
# vulnerability ID against a scan of the latest base image, which the caller
# supplies only when a newer base actually exists.
#
# Usage: analyze-base-fixes.sh <app-trivy.json> [base-latest-trivy.json]
#
# Environment (all optional, used for wording only):
#   HAS_NEW_BASE   "true" when a newer base image was found and scanned
#   FLOATING_TAG   floating channel tag, e.g. 10.0-alpine3.23
#   LATEST_VERSION concrete latest patch, e.g. 10.0.11-alpine3.23
#   LATEST_DIGEST  digest the floating tag currently resolves to, e.g. sha256:...
#   BASE_TAG       currently pinned tag, e.g. 10.0.9-alpine3.23
#   BASE_DIGEST    digest currently pinned in the Dockerfile, e.g. sha256:...
#
# The report shows the full tag@digest for the deployed and available images
# (so the digest can be copied straight into the Dockerfile) because a rebuilt
# base is often published under an unchanged version tag -- the digest is then
# the only thing that changed. Table cells use the short (12-char) digest to
# stay narrow.
#
# Output goes to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when set, otherwise to stdout.
